% Read temperature, humidity data from a ThingSpeak channel
% and visualize the data in a single plot using the MATLAB THINGSPEAKPLOT
% function.

% Channel 12397 contains data from the MathWorks Weather Station, located
% in Natick, Massachusetts. The data is collected once every minute. Field
% 3 contains the humidity data, field 4 contains temperature data and field
% 6 contains atmospheric pressure data.

% Channel ID to read data from
readChannelID = 209199;
% Temperature Field ID
TemperatureFieldID = 3;
% Humidity Field ID
HumidityFieldID = 2;
% Channel Read API Key 
% If your channel is private, then enter the read API
% Key between the '' below: 
readAPIKey = '4C55VSVK360LCI6W';

% Read Temperature Data. Learn more about the THINGSPEAKREAD function by
% going to the Documentation tab on the right side pane of this page.
